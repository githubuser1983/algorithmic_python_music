Infinite formulas for Pi - Music challenge:

One year ago or so, I stumbled upon an infinite number of formulas for pi:

My challenge is this: Can you interpret each formula as a musical piece?

Here you can find one interpretation of a very simple formula. For each part of the piece a better rational approximation of Pi is computed and its binary
digits are converted to left or right movements on a list of pitches, which creates the piece:
