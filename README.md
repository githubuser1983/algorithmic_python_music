Can you hear which known melodies the tracks correspond to?



python code:

https://github.com/githubuser1983/algorithmic_python_music/blob/main/12RootOf2.py



It is started like this:

sage 12RootOf2.py ./input/beethoven.mid

and will produce most of the time (depending on the parameters) ./input/beethoven.mid.mix.mid
